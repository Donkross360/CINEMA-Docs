First Steps
===========

This section will show you how to setup a development environment, what software packages are necessary, and provide you with a general template to add new features.

Requirements
------------
Because of how intertwined the various software modules are, when adding new features to C.I.N.E.M.A. you will most likely be working across the spectrum of C.I.N.E.M.A. software for this reason it is recommended you install ALL of the software in this section.

- Linux 
- Python
- NPM
- Ionic
- Some other stuff
- LAMP stack
- Wordpress

Installation
------------
Once you have installed the requirements in the previous section, you will want to install our development server.

    sudo apt-get install stuff
